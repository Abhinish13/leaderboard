      The <a href="http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2015/placing2015/">Placing Task</a> at 
      the <a href="http://www.multimediaeval.org/mediaeval2015/">MediaEval 2015 benchmark</a> 
      initiative requires participants to estimate the locations where multimedia items 
      (photos or videos) were captured.
      We provide live leaderboards of both sub-tasks (mobility and locale) to encourage 
      participants to work on their approaches throughout the coming months.
    p.
      The leaderboards are based on 30% of the test data; only the final results will be computed
      across all released test data. Shown are for each team the Average Error of the latest submission (in meters),
      the total number of runs submitted and the Average Error of the team's best submission.
    p.
      For simplicity, both tasks are currently evaluated according to the 
      <a href="http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/geod.html">Karney distance</a> between 
      predicted and actual location. The Karney distance is the main metric of the
      mobility sub-task. The main metric for the Locale sub-task will be based
      on the hierarchical distance (to be added later).
