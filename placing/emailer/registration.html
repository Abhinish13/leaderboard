when submitting a new run. Once the system has evaluated your run, it will be added to the leaderboard and you will also receive an email with the performance you achieved. Note that only the top 10 runs will be shown per subtask (estimation or verification) and modality (photo or video), so your run may not be visible if existing runs outperform yours.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions or need help, please contact us at $fromAddress.<br/>

Good luck!<br/>
