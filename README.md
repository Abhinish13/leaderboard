Prototype leaderboard for the Placing Task at MediaEval 2015. 
This code was cobbled together over a few days (replicate at your own risk).

# Instructions 
Replace the `example-config.json` file with the actual login/password of an STMP-enabled email account.

Start the application with `npm start`

Run the tests with `npm test`

Note that some necessary data files (such as the ground truth locale/mobility task data) are not included in this repository (as the contest is currently running).
